using above styling. create an html page called companyfootball.html. over here what I want to do is to send the link of this page to other companies and when they open it they will find it to be an issuing out of a challenge from us "Parables & Platters" . Sp make this page about challenging a company to a soccer match where they will fill out a form and then we'll get back to them with a response. they can set their own terms in the form. add plenty of options in this form - precisely 10 options. I'll add the formspree endpoint myself in the html. robustness - precision - error handling - no bugs - feel free to add your own content.
