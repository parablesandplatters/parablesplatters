                <li><strong>History of the Translation:</strong> Commissioned by King James I of England in 1604, the KJV was first published in 1611. It was translated by 47 scholars over a period of seven years.</li>
                <li><strong>Textual Sources:</strong> The KJV is based on the Textus Receptus for the New Testament and the Masoretic Text for the Old Testament. The translators used several earlier versions of the Bible to guide their work, including the Tyndale Bible.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Language:</strong> The KJV has had a profound influence on the English language, contributing many phrases and idioms that are still in use today, such as "the powers that be" and "a thorn in the flesh."</li>
                <li><strong>Apocrypha:</strong> The original 1611 edition included several books known as the Apocrypha, which are not included in most modern versions of the Bible.</li>
                <li><strong>Popularity:</strong> The KJV has been the most popular Bible translation in English-speaking countries for over 400 years. Its majestic and poetic language continues to resonate with millions of readers.</li>
                <li><strong>Revision Attempts:</strong> Despite being one of the oldest translations, the KJV is still beloved by many. There have been various attempts to modernize its language, but its traditional wording continues to maintain a sense of reverence and authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Synonyms and Translation Choices:</strong> One of the most famous characteristics of the KJV is its use of synonyms and distinct translation choices, which often offer depth and layered meanings to the text.</li>
