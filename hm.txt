My LORD.

I knew thee in the wilderness... in the land of
great drought.

According to my pasture, I Am filled... I Am filled with the Holy Ghost. 

My heart is of peace and I have not forgotten you. 

I will be unto you like a lion. like a Bull wit His horns. 

I will be like unto as leopard by the wayside I'll observe.

ndizoba ibhele baba... ilungkumkani.

Yes my LORD I am King, but only through you that it is so. 

I am forver and glory and peace and power and I rain all eternal songs unto Him.

He. Him. Hima. Shima. Mar Shaddai. Lord Hirashima. Worth O' Art - Glory - Bully Almighty. Worthy is thine name. and thy glory. and Honour. Worthy O' Olashi - The ulimate king's honour.
